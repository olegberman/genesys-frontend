We are going to show you how third party products could use Genesys for two factor authorization and authentication.

An identity provider in this case could be any service that has some information about you (phone number).
Good examples would be Facebook, Rogers or even Service Canada.

Let me give you a demo in case of facebook. 

First of all, imagine this was Facebook. 

> I have an account on Facebook, and I want to change my password in simple and secure way. 

- I log in with my username and password
- I want to change my password
- Facebook gives me a number to call
- Keep in mind that Facebook knows my phone number and so Genesys, so they can verify my identity
- I call Facebook
- The field with new password now unlocks
- I need to hang on until I'm done changing the password
- *I change my password*
- I'm done, and I hang up

I'm going to show you another quick demo before we go:

- Imagine if this was IMDB, that would suggest you movies based on your favorite movies that you specified on Facebook
- I go to IMDB and click "Login With Facebook"
- Because I was already logged into Facebook now I recieve a 4 digit code that I can now use to procceed with the login on this third-party service
- I enter the code and log in
- I get the recommendations and IMDB is now using the info I provided on Facebook

Thank you guys very much!
